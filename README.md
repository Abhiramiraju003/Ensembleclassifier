# Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews using Ensemble Classifier

## Overview
This project implements an **Ensemble Classifier** for **sentiment analysis** on product reviews. By combining multiple machine learning models, the ensemble approach improves classification accuracy and robustness, helping businesses analyze and understand customer sentiments effectively.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of product reviews collected from e-commerce platforms. Each review includes:
- **Review Text**: The actual customer feedback.
- **Sentiment Label**: Categorized as Positive (1), Negative (0), or Neutral (2).

### Preprocessing Steps:
1. Tokenization and text cleaning (removal of special characters, stopwords, etc.).
2. Converting text into numerical features using **TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or FastText**.
3. Feature scaling and transformation for model compatibility.

## Model Architecture
The ensemble classifier combines multiple machine learning models to improve sentiment classification performance. The models used include:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Captures complex relationships in text data.
- **Random Forest (RF)**: Provides feature importance and reduces overfitting.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)**: Enhances prediction accuracy using boosting techniques.
- **Voting or Stacking Mechanism**: Aggregates predictions from multiple models for improved results.

### Hyperparameters:
- **TF-IDF/Embedding Dimension**: 100-300
- **Number of Trees (RF, XGBoost)**: 100-500
- **SVM Kernel**: Linear, RBF
- **Boosting Learning Rate**: 0.01-0.1
- **Ensemble Strategy**: Hard Voting, Soft Voting, or Stacking

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm nltk
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ensemble-sentiment-analysis.git
cd ensemble-sentiment-analysis
```
2. Run the preprocessing script:
```bash
python preprocess.py
```
3. Train the ensemble model:
```bash
python train.py
```
4. Evaluate the model:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
5. Make predictions on new reviews:
```bash
python predict.py "The product quality is excellent!"
```

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set.
- Example predictions:
  - *"I love this product!" → Positive*
  - *"The quality is terrible." → Negative*

## Future Improvements
- Implementing **deep learning models (LSTM, BERT, or Transformers)** to enhance sentiment classification.
- Hyperparameter tuning using **Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization**.
- Expanding the dataset with more diverse product categories.
